Hi!

This is the LMLM Distribution. LMLM stands for "List of Mailing Lists Manager"
and is a framework to render descriptions of mailing lists of variable
kinds.

The LMLM homepage is: http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/LMLM/.

For more infromation consult the Mail::LMLM POD document on your system, or
look at the Iglu example under examples.

Regards,
